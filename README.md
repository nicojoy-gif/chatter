In this age of pictures, hashtags, Reels and Tiktoks, likes and comments, a traditional bookworm’s heaven would be a blog to get access to more text-based content. Chatter aims to be that heaven specifically for this kind of audience. A multi-functional platform where authors and readers can create and have access to their own content. Chatter aims to knock off competition from the likes of Hashnode and Medium in its first 2 years of launch.

Requirements And Implementation Guide: 
- User registration and authentication:
Chatter allows users to register and create their own account on the platform. Users can sign up using their email address or social media accounts like Facebook or Google. 
- Content creation:
Chatter provides a rich text editor that allows users to easily create and publish their own content. Users can write blog posts or any other content, and add images or videos to enhance their content. The blog posts should be authored/saved in Markdown, then it gets displayed as HTML when the posts are viewed.
- Content discovery:
Chatter provides a personalized feed based on the user's interests and reading history, making it easier for users to discover new content. Users can also browse and search for other user’s content. Users can explore different categories and tags to find content that interests them. 
- Social features:
Chatter provides social features like commenting and liking that allow users to interact with each other and engage in discussions. 
- Analytics:
Chatter provides detailed analytics that allow users to track their content's performance. Users can see how many views, likes, and comments their content has received and how many users have bookmarked their content.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
