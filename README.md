# chatter
In this age of pictures, hashtags, Reels and Tiktoks, likes and comments, a traditional bookworm’s heaven would be a blog to get access to more text-based content. Chatter aims to be that heaven specifically for this kind of audience. A multi-functional platform where authors and readers can create and have access to their own content. Chatter aims to knock off competition from the likes of Hashnode and Medium in its first 2 years of launch.

Requirements And Implementation Guide: 
- User registration and authentication:
Chatter allows users to register and create their own account on the platform. Users can sign up using their email address or social media accounts like Facebook or Google. 
- Content creation:
Chatter provides a rich text editor that allows users to easily create and publish their own content. Users can write blog posts or any other content, and add images or videos to enhance their content. The blog posts should be authored/saved in Markdown, then it gets displayed as HTML when the posts are viewed.
- Content discovery:
Chatter provides a personalized feed based on the user's interests and reading history, making it easier for users to discover new content. Users can also browse and search for other user’s content. Users can explore different categories and tags to find content that interests them. 
- Social features:
Chatter provides social features like commenting and liking that allow users to interact with each other and engage in discussions. 
- Analytics:
Chatter provides detailed analytics that allow users to track their content's performance. Users can see how many views, likes, and comments their content has received and how many users have bookmarked their content.

Best Practices: 
Build and deploy a scalable code base with proper code linting and formatting with Prettier and Eslint.
Ensure you use typescript with either Vuejs or React with necessary SEO in place.
You are required to build with either Firebase, Hasura or any backend technology that will allow you to store user data and carry out authentication.
It is important to allow the user of Chatter to write content with markdown.
Form validation is important.
At least 2 unit tests and 3 component tests should be present in the codebase.
